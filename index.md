### CPSC 120

*[Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-michael-e-and-joel)

    My most favorite lab that we did this semester was Lab 12 Part 1. I really enjoyed the concept of creating a gif using 10 different pictures like a flipbook. It was really cool to see the final result, and even some of the incorrect answers resulted in cool images as well.

*[Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-mearly25)

    Another favorite lab of mine was Lab 3, Part 3. This was the first one that involved a game, and although it was extremely simple, it was cool to see that I could code a little game. Little did I know there would be many more throughout the semester.  

*[Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-michael-e-lizbeth-a)

    Lab 5, Part 3 was another favorite of mine. I enjoyed this one because playing Blackjack was not something I would have thought to code. This assignment rally open up my eyes to what other games I could code, and adding to this game later in the semester was fun as well.
